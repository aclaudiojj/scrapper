# Scrapper APP

It is a web crawling app for github public projects.

## Access

The endpoint for the API is `/api` and there is one mandatory parameter, which is `project`.
The parameter must be a valid github public project, for example: `nunomaduro/collision`.
So, for development, the entire URL must be something like: `http://localhost/api?project=nunomaduro/collision`
